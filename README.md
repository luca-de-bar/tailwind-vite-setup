![Screenshot](/repo-screenshot.png)

This project automates the setup of a Vite application integrated with Tailwind CSS. It is designed to streamline the process of configuring a robust development environment with Vite and Tailwind, including a PostCSS plugin setup for Tailwind.

## Features

- **Vite Setup**: Automatically creates a new Vite project using the latest Vite template configured for vanilla JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Tailwind CSS is set up as a PostCSS plugin, allowing for powerful utility-first CSS directly in your HTML and JS files.
- **Configuration Files**: Automatically generates and configures `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.cjs` to ensure Tailwind functions correctly with PostCSS.
- **Prettier Configuration**: Installs and configures Prettier with a Tailwind plugin to automatically sort Tailwind classes, enhancing code readability and maintenance.
- **Enhanced UI**: Implements a welcoming interface with an appealing hover effect on the Tailwind logo, demonstrating the use of Tailwind utility classes for quick UI development.
